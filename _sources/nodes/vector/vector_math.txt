Vector Math Node
----------------

This is a versatile node. You can perform 1 operation on 1000's of
list-elements, or perform operations pairwise on two lists of 1000's of
elements, even if they are nested. It is therefore what we call
a *Vectorized* node, for an elaborate explanation of what this
means see this [introduction]().

Input and Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The node expects correct input for the chosen operation (called mode),
but it will fail gracefully with a message in the console if the input
is not right for the selected mode.

Some modes accept a Vector (U) and a Scalar (S), while other accepts
two Vectors (U, V). Some modes will output a Scalar (out),
others with output a Vector (W).

Modes
^^^^^

Most operations are self explanatory,
but in case they aren't then here is a quick overview:
